/*
  Video segment recording.

  Segments are written raw: the publisher's own bytes, byte for byte,
  into logs/<port2>/<date>/<session>.v<slot>.ts. That makes a recording
  a file VLC and ffplay open by double-click, append-only, and
  truncation-tolerant -- a killed process leaves a playable file with
  no finalisation step, which fragmented MP4 does not.

  Each segment is its own timestamped file rather than a part of a
  numbered set, so retention, natural sorting and the download route in
  the web UI all work on it unmodified.

  Why segments at all: the quota pass cannot delete the file currently
  being written (mtime within ACTIVE_FILE_GRACE_S), so one long file
  per session would make the whole session un-evictable and the quota
  pass would find nothing to free. Ten-minute segments bound the
  un-evictable working set at (segment + grace) * bitrate.
