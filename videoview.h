/*
  Video viewers.

  A viewer receives the publisher's bytes verbatim. It starts at the
  join anchor the scanner computed -- the PAT before the most recent
  confirmed random access point -- so the stream is decodable from the
  first byte it sees rather than from wherever "now" happens to be.

  The publisher never waits on a viewer. Each viewer holds an absolute
  position into the ring and is dropped if it falls far enough behind
  that its data has been overwritten. That is the whole reason the ring
  uses absolute offsets: "you have been lapped" is arithmetic, not a
  guess about wrap.
