/*
  ArduPilot binary-log writer over the "dataflash over MAVLink" protocol.

  Vehicle pushes REMOTE_LOG_DATA_BLOCK (msgid 184), 200 bytes per
  block, indexed by seqno. We write each block at offset
  seqno * 200 in logs/<port2>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/sessionN.bin (sparse file
  if there are gaps), ACK each received block with a
  REMOTE_LOG_BLOCK_STATUS=ACK back through the user-side MAVLink
  channel, and NACK gaps in the seqno stream with the same message
  type but status=NACK. NACKs are throttled to ~10 Hz per missing
  seqno; we abandon a missing block after 60 s elapsed or once the
  highest-seen seqno is 200 ahead — both numbers match MAVProxy's
  mavproxy_dataflash_logger.py.

  Strip behaviour (REMOTE_LOG_* messages don't reach the support
  engineer) lives in supportproxy.cpp; this class just owns the
  file + ACK/NACK state.

      Strict-start gate: the file is opened lazily ONLY when we see a

      silently discarded — the vehicle was already mid-log when
      SupportProxy activated, and writing at offset seqno*200 from
      mid-stream produces a multi-gigabyte sparse file that doesn't
      begin with the FMT records ArduPilot's .bin format requires,

      later (e.g. by sending REMOTE_LOG_BLOCK_STATUS=START to nudge
      the vehicle into restarting its stream), but the strict gate
      is the simplest correctness anchor for now.

      Three phases:

      * Before any DATA_BLOCK has arrived: emit a
        REMOTE_LOG_BLOCK_STATUS(status=ACK, seqno=START_MAGIC) at 1 Hz.
        That magic seqno (MAV_REMOTE_LOG_DATA_BLOCK_START) flips
        ArduPilot's AP_Logger_MAVLink::_sending_to_client to true,
        which is what makes logging_failed() return false (and so
        ArduPilot pre-arm pass) — see
        AP_Logger_MAVLink::handle_ack in libraries/AP_Logger. The
        side-effect on the vehicle is that it resets its seqno
        counter to 0 and starts streaming, which dovetails with our
        strict seqno==0 file-open gate.

      * After the first DATA_BLOCK (any_block_seen = true): drain
        pending ACKs and emit NACKs for gaps. ACKs are uncapped per
        tick — freeing the vehicle's pending-block queue faster
        reduces its drop rate, and one UDP send per ACK is cheap.
        NACKs are throttled to ~10 Hz per missing seqno and capped
        at MAX_NACKS_PER_TICK per call so a wide gap can't bury
        legitimate ACKs. The continuous ACK traffic also keeps the
        vehicle's 10-second client-timeout from firing.

      * Defence-in-depth re-START: while streaming, emit a low-rate
        START every START_KEEPALIVE_S so a post-reboot vehicle (whose
        _sending_to_client got cleared) resumes streaming within a
        few seconds. rotate_for_reboot() zeroes last_start_sent_s so
        the next tick() iteration fires START immediately.
