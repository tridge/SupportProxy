Serves a player per configured video slot, with a short-lived token so

what a browser can actually decode: of the streams this proxy carries,
H.264 plays and HEVC generally does not, so an unplayable stream gets
an explanation and a copyable ffplay/VLC command rather than a broken
<video> element.
